       "'Risk Management Systems in Banks\\nIntroduction\\nBanks in the process of financial intermediation are confronted with various kinds of financial\\nand non-financial risks viz., credit, interest rate, foreign exchange rate, liquidity, equity price,\\ncommodity price, legal, regulatory, reputational, operational, etc. These risks are highly\\ninterdependent and events that affect one area of risk can have ramifications for a range of other\\nrisk categories. Thus, top management of banks should attach considerable importance to\\nimprove the ability to identify, measure, monitor and control the overall level of risks\\nundertaken.\\nThe broad parameters of risk management function should encompass:\\ni) \\norganisational structure;\\nii) \\ncomprehensive risk measurement approach;\\niii) \\nrisk management policies approved by the Board which should be consistent with the\\nbroader business strategies, capital strength, management expertise and overall\\nwillingness to assume risk;\\niv) \\nguidelines and other parameters used to govern risk taking including detailed structure of\\nprudential limits;\\nv) \\nstrong MIS for reporting, monitoring and controlling risks;\\nvi) \\nwell laid out procedures, effective control and comprehensive risk reporting framework;\\nvii) \\nseparate risk management framework independent of operational Departments and with\\nclear delineation of levels of responsibility for management of  risk;  and\\nviii) \\nperiodical review and evaluation.\\n2.   Risk Management Structure\\n2.1 A major issue in establishing an appropriate risk management organisation structure is\\nchoosing between a centralised and decentralised structure.  The global trend is towards\\ncentralising risk management with integrated treasury management function to benefit from\\ninformation on aggregate exposure, natural netting of exposures, economies of scale and easier\\nreporting to top management. The primary responsibility of understanding the risks run by the\\nbank and ensuring that the risks are appropriately managed should clearly be vested with the\\nBoard of Directors.  The Board should set risk limits by assessing the bank’s risk and risk-\\nbearing capacity. At organisational level, overall risk management should be assigned to an\\nindependent Risk Management Committee or Executive Committee of the top Executives that\\nreports directly to the Board of Directors. The purpose of this top level committee is to empower\\none group with full responsibility of evaluating overall risks faced by the bank and determining\\nthe level of risks which will be in the best interest of the bank. At the same time, the Committee\\nshould hold the line management more accountable for the risks under their control, and the\\nperformance of the bank in that area.  The functions of Risk Management Committee should\\nessentially be to identify, monitor and measure the risk profile of the bank.  The Committee\\nshould also develop policies and procedures, verify the models that are used for pricing complex\\nproducts, review the risk models as development takes place in the markets and also identify new\\nrisks.  The risk policies should clearly spell out the quantitative prudential limits on various\\nsegments of banks’ operations.  Internationally, the trend is towards assigning risk limits in terms\\nof portfolio standards or Credit at Risk (credit risk) and Earnings at Risk and Value at Risk\\n(market risk). The Committee should design stress scenarios to measure the impact of unusual'"

It's essential to note that this is not an exhaustive list, and banks should be vigilant in monitoring their financial risks continuously.\"}"
